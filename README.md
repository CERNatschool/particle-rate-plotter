CERN@school Particle Rate Plotter
=================================

This code is for estimating the mean rate of particles
detected with CERN@school Timepix detectors.

For full instructions, see the wiki on the right.

* `process-frames.py`: processes Pixelman frames (Pixelman format);
* `make-plots.py`: makes the frame properties plots.

To run the unit tests, use:
