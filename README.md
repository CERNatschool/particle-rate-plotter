Particle Rate Plotter
=====================

This repository contains some basic code for analysing
particle detection rates from data obtained with the
Timepix hybrid silicon pixel detector as part of the
CERN@school programme.

##Datasets

We have supplied a number of datasets for testing the functionality of the
code - two consecutive hour-long datasets for the Mk1, and one
hour-long dataset for the MX-10. These may be found in the
`datasets` directory.

##Detector settings

For reference, we have supplied the detector and pixel configuration
settings files (as saved from Pixelman) for both detectors,
and the Threshold Equalisation (TEQ) information for the Mk1 detector.
These may be found in the `detsettings` directory.
