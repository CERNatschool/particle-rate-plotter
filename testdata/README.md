Test data for the Particle Rate Plotter code
============================================

This folder contains test data obtained with the following detectors:

* `LSC000001`: Jablotron MX-10 detector, chip ID B06-W0212;
* `LSC000030`: CERN@school Mk1 detector, chip ID E09-W0072,

on Wednesday 2nd April 2014.

It should be noted that, while the start times as recorded by the
detectors are slightly different, both were in fact started at the same
time. The system clocks on the laptops running the detectors were not
synchronised - something to bear in mind when analysing these datasets
and for future experiments!
